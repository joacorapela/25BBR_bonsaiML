Yes—very reasonable, and there’s precedent to expect a **goal-biased, forward “look-ahead”** during theta while the rat moves toward the platform.

### Why it’s reasonable

* In moving rats, hippocampal **theta sequences** (theta “sweeps”) compress short trajectories within each ~100–150 ms theta cycle. Several studies show these within-cycle sequences **look ahead toward intended destinations** and are modulated by current goals. ([PubMed][1])
* In the **Honeycomb maze**, hippocampal activity carries **goal-vector information** and reorganizes when the goal changes—so a prospective bias in theta sequences toward the active goal is a natural prediction. ([Nature][2])
* More recent work finds **goal-directed theta sequences** coordinated with prefrontal activity during runs to remembered rewards, consistent with prospective planning. ([cell.com][3])

### What to look for in your Honeycomb data

1. **Phase-resolved decoding:** decode position in 10–30 ms sub-bins across each theta cycle; test whether decoded positions sweep **from behind → current → ahead** along the **chosen path** toward the goal. Quantify slope and span per cycle. ([bioRxiv][4])
2. **Goal bias:** at each choice, score whether within-cycle sequences preferentially extend toward the **ultimately chosen platform** vs the alternative. (Classic “prospective” test at choice points.) ([PubMed][1])
3. **Distance dependence:** check if sweep **look-ahead length** increases with speed and/or **shrinks with proximity to the goal** (often reported). ([Nature][2])
4. **Task linkage:** in Honeycomb, place-cell vector fields (ConSinks) realign to the goal; ask whether theta sequence directions align with those **goal-pointing vectors** on each platform. ([Nature][2])
5. **Outcome sensitivity:** compare correct vs error choices; prospective sequence strength often predicts correct navigation. ([Nature][5])

### Quick analysis recipe

* Extract theta phase from CA1 LFP; segment cycles.
* Build standard place-field rate maps.
* For each cycle, run Bayesian decoding in phase sub-bins; fit a line to **decoded position vs phase** to get direction (sign) and span.
* Test alignment with the **vector to the goal** and with the **chosen platform** on that step of the Honeycomb sequence. (Shuffle spike times within cycles for a null.)

Bottom line: given the Honeycomb maze’s demonstrated **goal-vector coding** and the broader literature on **goal-reflective theta sequences**, you should indeed expect within-theta trajectories biased **toward the current goal**, especially at the binary choices that structure Honeycomb navigation.
