% Bonsai

Bonsai is a free and open-source visual reactive programming language widely
used for experimental control in neuroscience. Designed for performance,
flexibility, and ease of use, Bonsai enables scientists with little or no
programming background to build high-performance data acquisition and control
systems. With more than 7,000 downloads annually, nearly 100 citations per year
of the core paper, and over 1,000 new users in 2024 alone, Bonsai has become
the most widely adopted software platform in systems neuroscience. Its success
demonstrates the transformative role that sustainable, community-driven
research software can play in accelerating discovery.

% BBSRC grant

A central priority of UKRI is the application of artificial intelligence in
bioscience. In 2022 we recognised that integrating machine learning (ML) into
Bonsai could be transformative for experimental neuroscience. With BBSRC
support (BB/W019132/1), we developed Bonsai.ML, which extends Bonsai with
state-of-the-art ML methods. These include Linear Dynamical Systems, Hidden
Markov Models, Deep Neural Networks, and a Point-Process Decoder. Embedding
these models directly in Bonsai's reactive programming environment enables
adaptive, data-driven experimental designs that were previously out of reach
for many laboratories.

% Challenges

However, adding even the best ML methods to Bonsai.ML is not enough to guarantee
their uptake, since most Bonsai users have little or no training in ML, and
cannot immediately appreciate how these methods can aid their experimentation.

% This challenge is not unique to Bonsai.ML, but is common to all software
% seeking to provide ML functionality to non-ML-specialists.

% If successful, our proposed solution will serve as a role model to all these
% software.

% Solutions

We will accelerate the uptake and impact of Bonsai.ML through two complementary
strategies.
%
First, we will substantially revamp Bonsai.ML's documentation and strengthen
the current training and dissemination activities. This will empower
experimental neuroscientists to explore and identify ``killer applications''
of Bonsai.ML to neuroscience independently.
%
Second, we will work hand-in-hand with experimental neuroscientists to address
challenging neuroscience problems with Bonsai.ML, and together demonstrate
transformative applications of Bonsai.ML to neuroscience experimental control.
